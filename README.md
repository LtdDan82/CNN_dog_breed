# CNN_dog_breed
This project is the final project in the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree programm. In this project a CNN is used to identify a dog breed in a given photo. In case there is a human face on the image, the CNN returns the dog breed that is most equivalent to this human face.

### Libraries
scikit-learn, pandas, keras, glob, numpy, random, cv2, matplotlib, tqdm, PIL

### Project Motivation
I choosed this project to get more familiar with CNN's and computer vision in general.

### Result Summary
For the final CNN: InceptionV3 with dropout layer and final softmax layer for the classification a test-score of ~ 80 % was achieved.
A medium blog post about the results can be seen here: TODO
